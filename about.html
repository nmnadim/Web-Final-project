                        apartment paying guests. It is mainly based on home owners and customers. Here, the owner
                        can upload pictures with details of his apartment, house, office, garage. Besides, the customer
                        can know the house, room details, address well according to his needs or demands. By doing
                        this, the customer does not have to go in person. So it saves our time and money. On the
                        other hand, the owner does not have to give the details of the house repeatedly physically or
                        verbally.
